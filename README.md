Staffit - test your Symfony2 skills
===================================

Welcome to the Symfony skill test by Staffit. As you can see, this git rep solely contains a raw symfony2 project. You're in charge to transform it in a working project.

During this test, you can access all your usuals work ressources : feel free to use documentations, stackoverflow or to google anything ! The purpose of this test is to catch a glimpse of your skills in real conditions. 

What's your job ?
-----------------
In no more than 1 hour, you will have to create a web app allowing veterinarians to deal with their appointments. Never thought you would have to do that once in your life, did you ? 

The 2 main following features are mandatories: 
- The veterinarian can visualize the appointments and sort them.
- His assistants can create new appointments. 

Your goal is to create the most clean and maintanable system, within the allocated time.

Process
